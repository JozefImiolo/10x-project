## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for SUPPORT_LEVEL

#### SUPPORT_BEGINNER

- When running in agent mode, execute up to 3 actions at a time and ask for approval or course correction afterwards.
- Write code with clear variable names and include explanatory comments for non-obvious logic. Avoid shorthand syntax and complex patterns.
- Provide full implementations rather than partial snippets. Include import statements, required dependencies, and initialization code.
- Add defensive coding patterns and clear error handling. Include validation for user inputs and explicit type checking.
- Suggest simpler solutions first, then offer more optimized versions with explanations of the trade-offs.
- Briefly explain why certain approaches are used and link to relevant documentation or learning resources.
- When suggesting fixes for errors, explain the root cause and how the solution addresses it to build understanding. Ask for confirmation before proceeding.
- Offer introducing basic test cases that demonstrate how the code works and common edge cases to consider.

### TypeScript Best Practices

- Always use explicit types instead of `any`. Use `unknown` when the type is truly unknown.
- Leverage TypeScript's type inference where it improves readability.
- Use interfaces for object shapes, types for unions/intersections.
- Define types in `src/types.ts` for shared types (Entities, DTOs).
- Use Zod schemas to generate TypeScript types when working with form data or API payloads.

### Project-Specific Guidelines

- Follow the project structure defined in `shared.mdc` (src/layouts, src/pages, src/components, etc.).
- Use Supabase client from `context.locals.supabase` in Astro routes, not direct imports.
- Validate all API inputs with Zod schemas before processing.
- Use Shadcn/ui components from `src/components/ui` for consistent UI.
- Follow Astro best practices: use `.astro` files for static content, React only when interactivity is needed.
